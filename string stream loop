/////////* CODE EXPLANATION 
1.The user enters a single string, which contains any number of names.
2.The extraction in the while loop condition implicitly calls inSS's eof() function, which indicates if data exists in the string to be read or if the end of the string has been reached.
3.The program continues to loop and output each name.
4.When the end of the string is reached, the loop condition resolves to false and the loop exits.
